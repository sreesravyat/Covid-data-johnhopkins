The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption across the world, affecting every aspect of life from education and business to travel and social interactions. The impact of the pandemic has been particularly acute in developing countries, exacerbating existing challenges and exposing vulnerabilities in health care systems, supply chains, and social safety nets.

This project aims to provide an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the world and to analyze and visualize data related to its effects in various fields. The project uses data from the John Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard, which provides information on confirmed, recovered, and death cases by reporting date for each country, state, and province.

One of the main objectives of the project is to use data visualization techniques to gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic. Data visualization is a crucial step in any data science project as it helps in extracting useful information from large datasets. The project uses popular data science tools such as pandas and matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis and create visualizations.

In terms of data acquisition, the project uses a combination of sources, including the John Hopkins University database, world population data, and climate data. The world population data is used to calculate the number of cases per capita, while the climate data helps to understand how the climate may have affected the spread of the virus.

The project begins with the collection of COVID-19 data from the John Hopkins University database, which is available in a CSV format. The data is then converted into a data frame and cleaned to remove duplicates and irrelevant data. The project then merges the data for each country and calculates the total number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases for each country.

The project also examines the data for each country to determine the countries with the highest number of confirmed and death cases. The analysis reveals that the United States, India, Brazil, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, South Korea, Italy, and Turkey are the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, while the United States, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, Peru, the United Kingdom, Italy, Indonesia, and France are the countries with the highest number of death cases.

Furthermore, the project uses data visualization techniques to examine the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in different countries. The analysis shows that the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases was the highest for the United States, India, France, Germany, Brazil, and South Korea. The analysis also reveals that the exponential growth has stopped or become flat for countries such as India and Turkey.

The project also creates a horizontal bar plot showing the 20 most affected countries per 100 confirmed cases. The plot highlights that the United States, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Iran, Columbia, Mexico, Poland, Indonesia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Peru are the most affected countries.

Finally, the project examines the recovered cases for each country and creates a pie chart showing the distribution of confirmed, recovered, and death cases for each country. The project also creates a line graph showing the trend of confirmed cases over time for all countries.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on the world and the data analysis and visualization techniques used to understand the pandemic. The project highlights the importance of data science in providing insights into complex issues and underscores the need for continued efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
